# Blindspot

Blindspot answers one question: **"What am I missing?"**

You describe a plan, decision, or idea; a system of independent agents examines it from
multiple perspectives and surfaces a small number of useful, non-obvious blind spots —
hidden assumptions, dependencies, risks, and questions you haven't thought to ask.

This is a learning project for multi-agent systems, orchestration, and Python backend
development. See [`docs/project-brief.md`](docs/project-brief.md) for the full design
context and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the current project scope.

**Status:** project setup only. No domain logic, agents, or pipeline yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 (managed automatically by uv via `.python-version`)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency and environment management

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates `.venv` and installs the project plus dev dependencies (ruff, pytest, mypy),
pinned exactly as recorded in `uv.lock`.

## Development commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `uv run pytest` | Run the test suite |
| `uv run ruff check .` | Lint |
| `uv run ruff format .` | Format |
| `uv run mypy` | Type-check (`strict` mode) |
| `uv add <package>` | Add a runtime dependency |
| `uv add --dev <package>` | Add a dev-only dependency |
| `uv lock` | Refresh `uv.lock` after editing `pyproject.toml` by hand |

All checks run in CI on every push and pull request — see
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
